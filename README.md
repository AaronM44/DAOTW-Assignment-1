# DAOTW-Assignment-1

---

## Case Study
You have been tasked by the emergency services of New York City to investigate the
relationship between weather and the number of traffic collisions on a particular day. The
emergency services would like you to build two regression models; a linear regression model
and a Deep Neural Network regression model that can accurately predict the number of
collisions on a particular day of the week which will allow them to optimise emergency
response staff.

## Task
1.	Create at least one set of data using BigQuery.
2.	Host this/these csv data files in your GitHub repo for use with Colab
3.	Create a Colab sheet with an R kernel. This is what you will submit for assignment 1. It should be noted that you will have to structure this like a report with working code. For example, a mixture of text and code with a good linear structure. Your report should contain the queries you used to create your data with explanation of your thinking i.e. context.
4.	If you have carried out cleansing of data, you should export this data (or many pieces of data) and host them in GitHub for use in the python/tensorflow Colab sheet
5.	Create a (or many) Colab sheets with a python kernel for creating your regression models. Again, this should be written like a report
